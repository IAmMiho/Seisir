# Seisir
*Real-time seizure monitoring using the Microsoft band*

Winning-project for HackHarvard2015, in the category of official sponsor Microsoft-API

### Inspiration
We believe that Seisir is a revolutionary and life-saving technology. With the eyes put on the unpredictability and despair of epileptic seizures, our team  was driven to create an intelligent design, drawn by the IoT advent, that can act in a truly life-saving manner for people who suffer from epilepsy. From the elderly who so often live in solitude, to the children who can experience and not be aware of epileptic seizures during the night, we found a large set of people who can vastly improve from a reliable constant monitoring of seizure activity, and from the valuable clinical data that may arise from it.

### What it does
Seisir works in real time, pulling data from an array of sensors from the Microsoft Band and pushing it to a secure server. Once an individual's data is uploaded, Seisir uses Microsoft Azure API to analyze the likelihood of the patient being having seizure activity at the time. In case of positive feedback, one's family members and medical staff are contacted via SMS within seconds, giving the chance to save lives in emergency cases.

### What's next for Seisir - Epilepsy Monitoring App
It is our hope that the technology behind Seisir has the opportunity to be used in a research setting that is clinically relevant to seizures and other epileptiform activity. The different new sensors in development for future wearables also continually excite us for the room for breakthrough developments those create. As of now, it is our concern to implement new valuable data that came with the new Microsoft band 2 (gyroscope, skin conductance) in our prediction model.
